This file uses the following analytic dataset to address several research
questions regarding college-preparation trends at CA public K-12 schools

Dataset Name: cde_2014_and_2015_analytic_file created in external file
STAT6250-01_w17-team-0_project2_data_preparation.sas, which is assumed to be
in the same directory as this file

See included file for dataset properties

Question: What are the top five schools that experienced the biggest increase
in "Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)" between AY2014-15 and AY2015-16?

Rationale: This should help identify schoos to consider for new outreach based
upon increasing child-poverty levels.

Note: This compares the column "Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)" from frpm1415
to the column of the same name from frpm1516.

Methodology: When combining frpm1415 with frpm1516 during data preparation,
take the difference of values of "Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)" for each
school and create a new variable called frpm_rate_change_2014_to_2015. Here,
use proc sort to create a temporary sorted table in descending by
frpm_rate_change_2014_to_2015 and then proc print to display the first five
rows of the sorted dataset.

Question: Can "Percent (%) Eligible FRPM (K-12)" be used to predict the
proportion of high school graduates earning a combined score of at least 1500
on the SAT?

Rationale: This would help inform whether child-poverty levels are associated
with college-preparedness rates, providing a strong indicator for the types of
schools most in need of college-preparation outreach.

Note: This compares the column "Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)" from frpm1415
to the column PCTGE1500 from sat15.

Methodology: Use proc means to compute 5-number summaries of "Percent (%)
Eligible Free (K-12)" and PCTGE1500. Then use proc format to create formats
that bin both columns with respect to the proc means output. Then use proc freq
to create a cross-tab of the two variables with respect to the created formats.

Question: What are the top ten schools were the number of high school graduates
taking the SAT exceeds the number of high school graduates completing UC/CSU
entrance requirements by more than 100?

Rationale: This would help identify schools with significant gaps in
preparation specific for California's two public university systems, suggesting
where focused outreach on UC/CSU college-preparation might have the greatest
impact.

Note: This compares the column NUMTSTTAKR from sat15 to the column TOTAL from
gradaf15.

Methodology: When combining sat15 and gradaf15 during data preparation, take the
difference between NUMTSTTAKR and gradaf15 for each school and create a new
variable called excess_sat_takers. Here, use proc sort to create a temporary
sorted table in descending by excess_sat_takers and then proc print to display
the first 10 rows of the sorted dataset.
